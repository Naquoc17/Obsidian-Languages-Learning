# Compared to or Comparing to

## Compared to

- We use "compared to" when we have already a target to compare
- Example:
	- She is nicer, compared to you
		- She s nicer, ***when*** compared to you
		- She is nicer, ***if*** compared to you
	- You're nicer, compared to him
		- You're nicer, ***when*** compared to him
		- You're nicer, ***if*** compared to him
	- You're taller when measured against him
		- You are taller than he is

## Comparing to

- We use "comparing to" when we want to compare the first object to the second object
- Example:
	- Comparing you to her, she is nicer
		- Comparing you and her, she is nicer
	- Comparing you to him, you are nicer
		- Comparing you and him, you are nicer
	- Right now I think she is nice, in comparing her to you
