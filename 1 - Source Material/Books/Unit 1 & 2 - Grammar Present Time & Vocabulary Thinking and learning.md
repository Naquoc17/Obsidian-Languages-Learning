## Vocabulary: Thinking

**A Curious Case at the Office**

When Anna joined the new company, she was quite **[[Naive|naive]] ** about workplace politics. She assumed everyone was honest and helpful, but soon realized that was a risky **assumption**. One day, a strange email [[Baffle|baffled]]  her — it was full of unclear instructions. Anna tried to **[[Grasp|grasp]] ** its meaning but failed.

Feeling **[[Dubious|dubious]] ** about the sender’s intentions, she started to **[[Ponder|ponder]] ** what to do next. Should she reply or ignore it? It was a real **[[Dilemma|dilemma]] **. Her colleague, Mark, known for his **[[Cynical|cynical]] ** attitude, told her, "Always expect people to act in their own interest." That didn’t help much, but Anna had a **[[Hunch|hunch]] ** that something wasn’t right.

During lunch, they began to **[[Speculate|speculate]] ** about who could have sent the email and why. Was it a mistake or a hidden test? The more Anna thought about it, the more confused she became. It completely **baffled** her.

In the end, she decided not to act on guesses. Instead, she carefully **pondered** the situation again and asked for advice. She learned that in such cases, it's better not to **[[Assume|assume]] ** too much and avoid being too **naive**. Sometimes, a bit of healthy doubt and clear thinking can solve even the trickiest office mysteries.

## Vocabulary: Learning

**Modern Education: A Double-Edged Sword**

In today’s fast-paced world, many students find themselves under pressure, often forced to **[[Cram|cram]] ** for exams rather than truly understanding the subject. This is especially common when facing a **[[Mock Exam|mock exam]] **, which is supposed to prepare them for the real test but often only increases stress. While the **[[Curriculum|curriculum]] ** is designed to cover essential knowledge, some argue that it's too focused on theory and lacks practical application.

To keep up, students may turn to **[[Distance Learning|distance learning]] **, enjoying the flexibility it offers. However, without being **[[Conscientious|conscientious]] **, it's easy to fall behind. In some cases, the temptation to **[[Plagiarise|plagiarise]] ** becomes strong, especially when deadlines approach.

On the other hand, universities offer **[[Tutorial|tutorials]] ** and **[[Seminar|seminars]] ** to encourage discussion and deeper understanding. For those who want to improve quickly, **[[Intensive|intensive]] ** courses are available, requiring dedication but delivering fast results. Yet, the high cost of **[[Tuition|tuition]] ** can be a barrier for many learners.

Education today provides many opportunities, but success depends on balancing hard work with honest effort. Whether in a classroom or through a screen, students must stay responsible and make the most of the tools available to them.
