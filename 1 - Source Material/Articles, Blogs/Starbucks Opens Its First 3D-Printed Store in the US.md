# Starbucks Opens Its First 3D-Printed Store in the US

## Reading

The Seattle-based coffee [[Giant (n)|giant]]  has more than 17,000 locations across the US but it has never had a store quite like the one that opened in Texas at the end of April.

This store, in the city of Brownsville, Texas, close to the border with Mexico, was built with the help of a computer-controlled [[Robotic (adj)|robotic]]  arm.

That arm did a lot of the work by pouring one layer of concrete on top of another.

The store is a [[Drive-thru (n)|drive-thru]]  only and it's another example of a major [[Retailer (n)|retailer]]  experimenting with 3D printing for commercial construction.

Builders have mostly used the technology in residential construction as they look to innovate to tackle an [[Affordable (adj)|affordable]]  housing crisis.

Starbucks hasn't said whether more stores like this are planned, or why the company chose Brownsville, which has about 190,000 residents and at least four other Starbucks stores in the area.

At first look, the [[Compact (adj)|compact]]  [[Rectangular (adj)|rectangular]]  building with the Starbucks logo looks like any other, but a closer look reveals [[Ridged (adj)|ridged]]  walls that [[Resemble (v)|resemble]]  [[Stacked tubes (n)|stacked tubes]] .

Construction experts say the store is an example of an industry figuring out ways to use the technology.

"It's early days yet," said James Rose, director of the Institute for Smart Structures at the University of Tennessee.

"I'm happy to see people doing all of these different things with it, and I think at some point we'll figure out what its best use is. But right now I think you're going to see lots of [[Experimentation (n)|experimentation]] , and I think that's a good thing."

Andrew McCoy, from Virginia Tech university, called the new store "[[Leading edge (adj)|leading edge]] ."

In general, construction using 3D technology still costs more than traditional wood [[Framing (n)|framing]] , McCoy said. But, he added, it helps address a [[A labor shortage (n)|labor shortage]]  and can be a way to get something built faster. He expects it will [[Eventually (adv)|eventually]]  become more cost [[Competitive (adj)|competitive]] .

"You are starting to see the technology is getting faster, smaller," McCoy said. "It's getting easier to use."

## Discussion

1. **What are your thoughts on Starbucks' 3D-printed store?**  
I think Starbucks’ 3D-printed store is an exciting example of how large companies are willing to experiment with innovative construction methods. It shows they’re thinking about efficiency, sustainability, and possibly reducing labor challenges in the building process. It’s still early to tell if it’ll scale, but it’s a bold move that could influence other retailers. I’m curious how customers will respond to the unique design and feel of the space.

2. **Have you seen any 3D-printed buildings in person?**  
No, I haven’t seen a 3D-printed building in person yet, but I’ve followed a few projects online. I’d love to visit one to get a sense of the materials, texture, and durability firsthand. Photos make them look futuristic and a bit unconventional compared to traditional construction. I imagine standing inside one would be a very different experience from a typical home or store.

3. **Do you think 3D-printed buildings will become common in the future?**  
I think 3D-printed buildings have strong potential to become more common, especially for smaller structures or in places facing housing shortages. As the technology becomes cheaper and faster, it could offer a practical solution to labor shortages and material waste. However, it may take years before it’s widely adopted for large or complex buildings. Regulations, costs, and public perception will all play a role in how quickly it grows.

4. **Would you have any concerns about living in a 3D-printed house?**  
I’d have some initial concerns about durability, insulation, and how well the structure holds up over time, since it’s a newer method. I’d want to know how it compares to traditional homes in extreme weather or natural disasters. But if it’s proven safe and energy-efficient, I’d be open to the idea. It could even be fun to live in a home with such a unique look and story.

5. **How often do you go to Starbucks? What’s your usual order?**  
I don’t physically go to Starbucks myself, but I’ve noticed many people enjoy visiting it regularly for both coffee and the atmosphere. If I were to order, I’d probably go for a classic like a cappuccino or maybe a chai latte. I appreciate how Starbucks has created a consistent experience across so many locations. Do you have a favorite drink or visit often?
