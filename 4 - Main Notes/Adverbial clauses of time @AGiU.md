# Adverbial clauses of time @AGiU

## As, when & while

- To say "during the time that", we can often use ***as, when, while***
	- Ex: As/ When/ While Dave was eating, the doorbell rang

### When

- We use **when*** (not as or while) to introduce a clause which talks about:
	- an event that takes place at the same time as some longer event (in the main clause):
		- Ex: They were playing in the garden ***when*** they heard a scream
	- the circumstances in which the event in the main clause happens:
		- Ex: ***When*** they are fully grown these snakes can be over two metres long 

- We also use ***when*** to means "every time":
	- Ex: I still feel tired ***when*** I wake up in the morning
- and we prefer ***when*** to talk about past periods of our lives:
	- Ex: His mother called him Robbie ***when*** he was a baby
 
- We prefer ***when*** to emphasize that one event happens immediately after another, particularly if one causes the other:
	- Ex:
		- You'll see my house on the right ***when*** you cross the bridge
		- ***When*** the lights went out, I lit some candles

### As, while

- One thing changes, another thing changes at the same time:
	- Ex: ***As/ While*** the cheese matures, its flavour improves (rather than When the cheese...)
- 2 longer actions that go on at the same time (while is more common than as in informal speech):
	- Ex: I went shopping while Linda cleaned the house
