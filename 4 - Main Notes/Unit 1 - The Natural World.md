## Environmental Impacts of [[Logging 1|Logging]] 

### A

- from shipping crates to paper bags, the locking industry supplies the raw materials for an array of products
- however this is not without untold harm to the environment
- the damage includes habitat loss, pollution and climate change, with the effects [[to span|spanning]]  the globe from the rain forests of Central Africa, Southeast Asia and South America to the northern forests of Canada and  Scandinavia
- The effects of logging extend beyond just the felling of [[swath|a swath of]]  trees
- nutrients water and shelter for plants, animals and microorganisms throughout the ecosystem are also lost
- many life forms - both [[terrestrial]] and [[Aquatic 1]] are becoming endangered as forests [[vanish]]

### B

- Trees protect the soil [[beneath]] them; thus, tree loss can affect soil [[integrity]]. 
- For example, the rain forest floor, home to [[myriad]] plant life as well as insects, worms, reptiles and amphibians, and small mammals, relies on a dense [[canopy]] of branches and leaves to keep it healthy and intact. 
- The canopy prevents surface [[runoff]] by intercepting heavy rainfall so that water can drip down slowly onto the [[porous]] earth. 
- Tree roots also stabilize the soil and help prevent [[erosion]]. 
- In return, a healthy soil encourages root development and [[microbial]] activity, which contribute to tree growth and well-being. 
- A major factor in logging-related soil damage comes from road building, with trucks and other heavy equipment compressing the spongy soil, creating furrows where water collects, and disrupting the underground water flow. 
- Eventually, the topsoil wears away, leaving behind an [[infertile]] layer of rocks and hard clay.

### C

**[[Logging 1|Logging]] ** can also damage **[[Aquatic 1]] habitats**. **Vegetation** along rivers and stream banks helps maintain a [[Steady|steady]]  water flow by [[Block|blocking]]  the [[Entry|entry]]  of soil and other [[Residue|residue]] , and tree [[Shade|shade]]  **[[Inhibit|inhibits]] ** the growth of [[Algae|algae]] . Removing trees **[[Obliterate|obliterates]] ** these benefits. When [[Erode|eroding]]  soil [[Flow|flows]]  into waterways, the [[Organic|organic]]  matter within it consumes more [[Oxygen|oxygen]] , which can lead to oxygen [[Depletion|depletion]]  in the water, **killing** fish and other **aquatic** [[Wildlife|wildlife]] .

### D

Trees provide a natural **[[Defense|defense]] ** against air **[[Pollution|pollution]] **. They remove [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]]  from the atmosphere while they **[[Emit|emit]] ** oxygen, and their leaves [[Filter|filter]]  **[[Pollutant|pollutants]] ** from the air. Cutting down trees keeps **[[Pollutant|pollutants]] ** [[Airborne|airborne]] , where they can mix with water [[Vapor|vapor¹]]  and form [[Acid rain|acid rain]] . Water quality in nearby streams and rivers also [[Deteriorate|deteriorates]]  as tree loss contributes to increased [[Sedimentation|sedimentation]] .


### E

In a healthy forest [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] , trees [[Draw (moisture)|draw moisture]]  from the soil and release it into the atmosphere while they provide [[Shade|shade]]  to lessen [[Evaporation|evaporation]] . Thus, **[[Deforestation|deforestation]]  impacts** [[Rainfall|rainfall]]  patterns, leading to [[Flooding|flooding]]  as well as [[Drought|drought]]  and forest **fires**. **Deforestation** is responsible for about one-fifth of carbon dioxide [[Emission|emissions]]  worldwide, making it a major [[Contributor|contributor]]  to climate change—in particular, **[[Global warming|global warming]] **. In the Amazon [[Basin|basin]]  alone, **deforestation** is responsible for millions of tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere annually. Some **logging** companies burn large [[Tract|tracts]]  of forest just to [[Facilitate|facilitate]]  access to one area—a practice² that [[Discharge|discharges]]  even more carbon dioxide.


### F

Forests, especially the [[Tropical rain forest|tropical rain forests]] , are a [[Vital|vital]]  [[Natural resource|natural resource]]  with [[Extensive|extensive]]  [[Biodiversity|biodiversity]]  and [[Irreplaceable|irreplaceable]]  wildlife **habitats**. More responsible **logging** practices would help [[Ensure|ensure]]  that they are protected for [[Future generations|future generations]] .
