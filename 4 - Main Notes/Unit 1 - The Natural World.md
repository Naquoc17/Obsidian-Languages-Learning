## Environmental Impacts of [[logging|Logging]] 

### A

- from shipping crates to paper bags, the locking industry supplies the raw materials for an array of products
- however this is not without untold harm to the environment
- the damage includes habitat loss, pollution and climate change, with the effects [[to span|spanning]]  the globe from the rain forests of Central Africa, Southeast Asia and South America to the northern forests of Canada and  Scandinavia
- The effects of logging extend beyond just the felling of [[swath|a swath of]]  trees
- nutrients water and shelter for plants, animals and microorganisms throughout the ecosystem are also lost
- many life forms - both [[terrestrial]] and [[aquatic]] are becoming endangered as forests [[vanish]]

### B

- Trees protect the soil [[beneath]] them; thus, tree loss can affect soil [[integrity]]. 
- For example, the rain forest floor, home to [[myriad]] plant life as well as insects, worms, reptiles and amphibians, and small mammals, relies on a dense [[canopy]] of branches and leaves to keep it healthy and intact. 
- The canopy prevents surface [[runoff]] by intercepting heavy rainfall so that water can drip down slowly onto the [[porous]] earth. 
- Tree roots also stabilize the soil and help prevent [[erosion]]. 
- In return, a healthy soil encourages root development and [[microbial]] activity, which contribute to tree growth and well-being. 
- A major factor in logging-related soil damage comes from road building, with trucks and other heavy equipment compressing the spongy soil, creating furrows where water collects, and disrupting the underground water flow. 
- Eventually, the topsoil wears away, leaving behind an [[infertile]] layer of rocks and hard clay.
