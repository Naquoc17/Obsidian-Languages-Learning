## Present perfect continuous

| Usecase                                         | Example                                                     |

| Actions in the past continuing up to now        | We have been driving for hours. Can't we have a break soon? |
| Actions stopping just before the present moment | I'm out of breath because I've been running to get here     |
**Note:**
- We often use this tense with phrases like "all day/ week/ year/ etc."
- Not used with "ever/ never"
- Sometimes present perfect simple and continuous have the same meaning:
	- I have worked at the airport for 4 years = I have been working at the airport for 4 years
