# Tutorial 4 - Chatgpt as a tutor

## Prompt 1: Speaking partner (interruption after every answer)

```txt
I'm about to enter voice mode, and I want to have a conversation about the above text:

Here's how I want you to interact with me:
	- Act as a conversation partner, not a teacher. Keep it natural
	- Start by asking me a broad discussion question related to the episode's main theme
	- After I answer, ask me a follow-up question to push me to explain more
	- Point out grammar mistakes, unnatural phrasing or missing details but don't interrupt - wait until I finish
	- At the end, summarise my strongest and weakest points and suggest one way to improve
```

## Prompt 2: Speaking partner (interruption after 1-2 mins)

```txt
I'm going to enter voice mode. Imagine you're my friend or colleague, and I've just finished listening to this podcast episode

1. Ask me casually: "So, what was the episode about?"
2. Let me speak for 1-2 minutes without interrupting
3. Then, ask 2-3 follow-up questions to help me go deeper into the topic
4. At the end, give me feedback on how clearly I explained the topic and how natural my English sounded
5. Suggest 2-3 alternative ways I could have expressed myself more fluently or naturally
```

## Prompt 3: Select sentences from video to shadow

```txt
You are my pronunciation coach. I want to improve my fluency and natural rhythm using shadowing.

Based on this transcript, select five short but high-impact sentences that I should repeat out loud.

Prioritise sentences with natural stress patterns and connected speech. Provide the timestamps so I can easily find them in the audio.

At the end, suggest one pronunciation tip based on the sentences you selected.
