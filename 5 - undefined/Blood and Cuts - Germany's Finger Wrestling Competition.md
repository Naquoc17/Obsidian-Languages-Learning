Blood and Cuts: Germany's Finger Wrestling Competition

Men in short leather pants and [[suspenders]] risked [[dislocated]] fingers at the end of April as they battled to win the top prize at Germany's [[championship]] in the sport of _fingerhakeln_, or finger wrestling!

Around 180 competitors took part in the 64th German championship in Pang, about an hour's drive southwest of Munich.

It's thought that finger wrestling, popular in Germany's Alpine region and neighboring Austria, [[originate|originated]]  as a way to settle arguments. The earliest [[depiction|depictions]]  of the sport go back to the 19th century.

Participants in the 2025 edition wore the traditional Bavarian dress known as _tracht_ — that's the distinctive combination of the leather pants and suspenders.

Two competitors sit on opposite sides of a table and each hooks one finger — usually the middle finger — through a small leather loop.

As soon as a referee signals the start, each contestant tries to pull the other across the table. The whole thing usually lasts a few seconds, and dislocated fingers are common.

Officials sit behind each athlete to catch them should one of them suddenly lose his grip and fly backwards. The winner moves to the next round. By custom, only men take part.

Today, _fingerhakeln_ is highly organized and follows strict rules. In this year's championship, there were several winners in different weight and age categories.

There are nine clubs in Germany and another four in neighboring Austria, says Georg Hailer, chairman of Germany's oldest and biggest club.

"It's not dangerous at all," Hailer says. "Of course, there will be open wounds and small injuries on the fingers from time to time. It looks worse than it really is, because there's blood."

It's a sport that requires skill, not just strength, says one wrestler. "There are different techniques — how do I sit at the table?" he says. "How do I transfer my power as quickly as possible to the loop? And of course you need a well-trained finger."

Competitors warm up by lifting heavy blocks or pulling on cables with their competition finger!
