Blood and Cuts: Germany's Finger Wrestling Competition

Men in short leather pants and [[suspenders]] risked [[dislocated]] fingers at the end of April as they battled to win the top prize at Germany's [[championship]] in the sport of _fingerhakeln_, or finger wrestling!

Around 180 competitors took part in the 64th German championship in Pang, about an hour's drive southwest of Munich.

It's thought that finger wrestling, popular in Germany's Alpine region and neighboring Austria, [[originate|originated]]  as a way to settle arguments. The earliest [[depiction|depictions]]  of the sport go back to the 19th century.

Participants in the 2025 edition wore the [[traditional]] Bavarian dress known as _tracht_ — that's the distinctive combination of the leather pants and suspenders.

Two competitors sit on opposite sides of a table and each hooks one finger — usually the middle finger — through a small leather loop.

As soon as a referee signals the start, each [[contestant]] tries to pull the other across the table. The whole thing usually lasts a few seconds, and dislocated fingers are common.

Officials sit behind each athlete to catch them should one of them suddenly lose his [[grip]] and fly backwards. The winner moves to the next round. By custom, only men take part.

Today, _fingerhakeln_ is highly organized and follows strict rules. In this year's championship, there were several winners in different weight and age categories.

There are nine clubs in Germany and another four in neighboring Austria, says Georg Hailer, chairman of Germany's oldest and biggest club.

"It's not dangerous at all," Hailer says. "Of course, there will be open wounds and small injuries on the fingers from time to time. It looks worse than it really is, because there's blood."

It's a sport that requires skill, not just strength, says one wrestler. "There are different techniques — how do I sit at the table?" he says. "How do I transfer my power as quickly as possible to the loop? And of course you need a well-trained finger."

Competitors warm up by lifting heavy blocks or pulling on cables with their competition finger!


## Discussion

### 1. What are your thoughts on fingerhakeln

Fingerhakeln sounds like a fascinating and intense traditional sport.  
It's interesting how something that seems so simple—pulling with a finger—can require such skill and technique.  
The fact that it has strict rules and different categories shows it's taken seriously.  
It’s also impressive that people train and even warm up their fingers for this.  
Overall, it's a unique mix of tradition, strength, and strategy.

### 2. Do you think you'd enjoy watching  competition like this in person?

Yes, I think watching a fingerhakeln competition in person could be very entertaining.  
Seeing the tension and focus between two competitors would be exciting, especially knowing how much technique is involved.  
It might be more intense than expected because of the physical strain and quick outcomes.  
Plus, the atmosphere with cheering fans and traditions could add to the experience.  
It’s always fun to see something new and culturally specific.

### 3. Have you ever had a finger or arm wrestling match with someone?

Yes, I’ve had arm wrestling matches with friends before, mostly for fun.  
It usually turns into a laughing competition more than anything serious.  
I’ve never done finger wrestling, though, and it sounds much more painful.  
Arm wrestling already strains your muscles, so I imagine fingerhakeln is even tougher on the joints.  
Still, it’s a fun way to test strength.

### 4. Are there any unique or traditional competitions or sports inyour country?

Yes, many countries have traditional sports or games that are unique.  
For example, in some regions, people compete in tug-of-war, cheese rolling, or log cutting.  
These events often take place during festivals and bring communities together.  
They might seem odd to outsiders, but they have cultural and historical significance.  
It’s a great way to keep traditions alive.

### 5. Have you ever had a sports injury? What happened?

Yes, I once sprained my ankle while playing basketball.  
I landed awkwardly after jumping for a rebound, and my foot twisted the wrong way.  
It was swollen for days, and I had to stay off it for a few weeks.  
It taught me how important stretching and proper form are.  
Since then, I’ve been more careful during physical activities.
