## Environmental Impacts of [[logging|Logging]] 

### A

- from shipping crates to paper bags, the locking industry supplies the raw materials for an array of products
- however this is not without untold harm to the environment
- the damage includes habitat loss, pollution and climate change, with the effects [[to span|spanning]]  the globe from the rain forests of Central Africa, Southeast Asia and South America to the northern forests of Canada and  Scandinavia
- The effects of logging extend beyond just the felling of [[swath|a swath of]]  trees
- nutrients water and shelter for plants, animals and microorganisms throughout the ecosystem are also lost
- many life forms - both [[terrestrial]] and [[aquatic]] are becoming endangered as forests [[vanish]]

### B

- Trees protect the soil [[beneath]] them; thus, tree loss can affect soil [[integrity]]. 
- For example, the rain forest floor, home to [[myriad]] plant life as well as insects, worms, reptiles and amphibians, and small mammals, relies on a dense [[canopy]] of branches and leaves to keep it healthy and intact. 
- The canopy prevents surface [[runoff]] by intercepting heavy rainfall so that water can drip down slowly onto the [[porous]] earth. 
- Tree roots also stabilize the soil and help prevent [[erosion]]. 
- In return, a healthy soil encourages root development and [[microbial]] activity, which contribute to tree growth and well-being. 
- A major factor in logging-related soil damage comes from road building, with trucks and other heavy equipment compressing the spongy soil, creating furrows where water collects, and disrupting the underground water flow. 
- Eventually, the topsoil wears away, leaving behind an [[infertile]] layer of rocks and hard clay.

### C

_Logging_ can also damage _aquatic habitats_. _Vegetation_ along rivers and stream banks helps maintain a steady water flow by blocking the entry of soil and other residue, and tree shade _inhibits_ the growth of algae. Removing trees _obliterates_ these benefits. When eroding soil flows into waterways, the organic matter within it consumes more oxygen, which can lead to oxygen depletion in the water, _killing_ fish and other _aquatic_ wildlife.

### D

Trees provide a natural _defense_ against air _pollution_. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while they _emit_ oxygen, and their leaves filter _pollutants_ from the air. Cutting down trees keeps _pollutants_ airborne, where they can mix with water vapor¹ and form acid rain. Water quality in nearby streams and rivers also deteriorates as tree loss contributes to increased sedimentation.

### E

In a healthy forest ecosystem, trees draw moisture from the soil and release it into the atmosphere while they provide shade to lessen evaporation. Thus, _deforestation impacts_ rainfall patterns, leading to flooding as well as drought and forest _fires_. _Deforestation_ is responsible for about one-fifth of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, making it a major contributor to climate change—in particular, _global warming_. In the Amazon basin alone, _deforestation_ is responsible for millions of tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere annually. Some _logging_ companies burn large tracts of forest just to facilitate access to one area—a practice² that discharges even more carbon dioxide.

### F

Forests, especially the tropical rain forests, are a vital natural resource with extensive biodiversity and irreplaceable wildlife _habitats_. More responsible _logging_ practices would help ensure that they are protected for future generations.
