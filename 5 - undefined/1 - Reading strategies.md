## Health-Tea

*Sid Cowans looks at the health properties of a favourite drink*

If you are a tea drinker you have probably heard of **tannins**, which are plant based chemicals found in tea. They are responsible for the **astringent** bitter taste sometimes associated with tea. When you drink a cup of tea, it usually dissolves and remains clear unless the water is too cold or too **alkaline**.

Tannins occur in many different types of plants and food, but are especially present in **oak galls**, which have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine due to their health giving properties. Tannins are often present in drinks and medicine because they are **soluble** in water, but how much they dissolve depends on factors like temperature and the chemical make up of the liquid.
